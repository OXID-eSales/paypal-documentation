Introduction
============

The PayPal module integrates the fast and secure payment via PayPal in the OXID eShop. This allows the customer to pay the order by using the payment and address information of his PayPal account without the necessity of entering the information in the shop. On the other hand, shop operators are protected against payment defaults, as the payment request is verified and confirmed in real time.
